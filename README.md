# SDP-Robot-Project
This is some of my contributions to my group project from UoE System Design Project.

We were a group of 7 pupils, our finished project, DigiNotes, won 'Best overall project in year'.

We built a robot which was an automatic page flipper which uploaded scanned pages from your book up to our website. Our website had a profile account which could sort, store and export your scans.

Our robot featured a silicone soft robotoics page flipper, a raspberry pi camera and image processing before becoming a 'scan'.
